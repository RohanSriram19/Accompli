  Evidence Level: ${intervention.evidenceLevel}
  Best for: ${intervention.conditions.join(', ')}
  Summary: ${intervention.summary}
  Source: ${intervention.source}
`).join('')}

Research-Based Implementation Notes:
- Always start with least restrictive, most natural interventions
- Combine interventions when research supports it (e.g., self-monitoring + explicit instruction)
- Monitor progress weekly using data-driven decision making
- Consider cultural and linguistic factors in intervention selection
- Ensure interventions are implemented with fidelity

Educational Standards Adaptations Available:
${this.getStandardAdaptations(studentData.academicFocus || 'reading', studentData.gradeLevel || 'K-2')
  .map(standard => `
• ${standard.domain}: ${standard.standard}
  Adaptations: ${standard.adaptations.slice(0, 2).join(', ')}
`).join('')}

Decision-Making Framework (from IES Practice Guides):
1. Select interventions with strong research evidence for this population
2. Consider implementation feasibility in current setting
3. Plan for systematic data collection and progress monitoring
4. Prepare for intervention modification based on student response
